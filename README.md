# Celo Blockchain:

Celo is a Proof of Stake Layer-1 EVM compatible blockchain, optimized for DeFi, which is designed to be mobile-first and climate friendly. With it's mobile-first design, it aims to bring the benefits of DeFi to the 6 billion+ market of smartphones in the world.

Being fully EVM compatible, developers can port their Solidity dApps to Celo easily, just by changing the RPC URL during deployment.

Celo also uses an ultralight client, which utilizes Zero-Knowledge proofs, to allow for syncing with the Celo blockchain extremely fast. The ZKP allows for quick verification of the chain syncing computation, without having to sync the entire chain locally.

The Celo Blockchain and Celo Core Contracts (a set of smart contracts deployed by the Celo team) form together the Celo Protocol.
